# TicTacToe

Basic tic tac toe game in the command line.

By default this game will have one computer player and one human player. It can be set up to have two computers play against each other, or two humans play against each other.

There is also a basic interface that sets up a player class, requiring the class to identify if it will be X or O, as well as what the Move method does. One could potentially add
a different logic for a computer player, or connect a player to a different IP address.
